#   they used in the stata file with some minor changes

  rename("Anxiety Condition" = anxcond3,
         "Immigration DV" = immigration,

  # Now we will clean up the values within the columns so that they make 
  #   intuitive sense when read

  
  
  # Analysis of "Anxiety Condition"
  
  # Anxcond3 refers to the three different treatment conditions
  #   these are: RELAX, NEUTRAL, ANXIETY (labeled 0,1,2)
  # Note that there is one NA value here which I have removed
  
  filter(!is.na(`Anxiety Condition`)) %>% 
  
  # In the stata code, table 1 has the clause if anxcond3 ~=0
  #   it also states that table 1 excludes the "relax" condition
  #   so we know that 0 is the relax condition
  # In the stata code for appendix H, we can see that model 1 is neutral
  #   condition and model 2 is anxiety condition. They use the values 1 
  #   and 2 from the anxcond3 column respectivly to make these, so we 
  #   also know these values

  mutate (`Anxiety Condition` = case_when(
                                `Anxiety Condition` == 0 ~ "Relax",
                                `Anxiety Condition` == 1 ~ "Neutral",
                                TRUE ~ "Anxiety"
                                )) %>% 
  
  
  # Analysis of "Immigration DV"
  
  # The immigration column, labeled immigration DV, presumably means 
  #   immigration dependant variable as this is measured during the survey
  #   after the experiment occurs (i.e. this is the outcome)
  # The min is 1, the max is 5, so we can assume that this refers to 
  #   the immigration preferences given by the 5 point scale in the survey
  # These preferences range from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree"
  # In the appendix it states that "higher values represent more 
  #   anti-immigrant attitudes"
  # This is given as a dbl in the r code, which shows that it is a mix of the 
  #   answers to the 5 questions regarding immigration from the appendix.

  
  # Analysis of "SCD (Mean) While Answering Questions"

  # SCD refers to Skin Conductance. We know this because of its use in figure 3
  #   in the appendix. 
  # Skin conductance was measured during the immigration questionnaire.
  # There are 10 NA's here, which could suggest that some people did not want to
  #   be tested in this manner?
  # A higher skin conductance indicates more anxiety


  # Analysis of Story Condition

  # The participants were primed with an immigration story frame before shown the
  #   video condition. 
  # This column only contains values 0 and 1.
  # It can be assumed by their ordering in the appendix / discussion in the text
  #   that Jose is condition 0 and Niko is condition 1 (the names of the two conditions)

  mutate(`Story Condition` = case_when(
                                `Story Condition` == 0 ~ "Jose",
                                TRUE ~ "Niko"
                                )) 

  
  # Analysis of Anxiety Indicator Variable

  # This variable is described as an indicator variable for the treatment status
  #   Its values are exculsively 0 and 1, and its mean value is .295
  # We can see by comparing this to the Anxiety Condition column, that the value
  #    it 1 when the condition is Anxiety, and 0 otherwise
  # This makes intuitive sense why the mean value is near .3, as there are 3 conditions
  #   so it should be about a third of the total number.


  # Analysis of Ideology Column

  # This variable is part of the pretreatment demographic survey. It includes things
  #   like party identification
  # The minimum is a 1, and the max is a 7 suggesting that a likert scale was possibly
  #   used? There is one NA
  # There is no indication as to which levels of ideology indicate specific ideologies


  # Analysis of Race Column

  # This variable is part of the pretreatment demographic survey.
  # It contains values 1 through 7. There is one NA.
  # It doesn't seem like they give info regarding what the different categories
  #   indicate

  # Income and Education are similiar
