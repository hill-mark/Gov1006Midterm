# "Physiological Arousal and Political Beliefs" Replication

I am replicating the paper called ["Physiological Arousal and Political Beliefs"](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jooajulialee/files/physiological_arousal.pdf) in R code using [replication code](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/24318) provided in the Harvard dataverse.

I also reference some figures from [the appendix](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111%2Fpops.12173&file=pops12173-sup-0001-si.pdf).
